# PAW Production Roadmap

Last updated: 2026-01-01

## Status

- Documentation audit complete; publication and external readiness tasks remain.

## Roadmap

### Public testnet publication

- [ ] Publish/pin live public endpoints in `networks/paw-testnet-1/STATUS.md` and rerun `scripts/devnet/validate-remote-artifacts.sh <cdn-url>` after CDN upload.
- [ ] Rebuild/publish docs-site once endpoints are live.
- [ ] Run link check against published endpoints after publication.

### External readiness

- [ ] External security audit by recognized firm (deferred per directive).
- [ ] 3+ months testnet operation.
- [ ] Bug bounty program.
- [ ] Community channels (Discord/Telegram).

## Details

- Remote validation is blocked until CDN artifacts are publicly reachable.
- External items require organization-level coordination.
