# paw-testnet-1 Artifact Status

**Last updated:** 2026-01-12T00:25:00Z

## Current Repository Contents
- `genesis.json`: Canonical 4-validator genesis generated by `scripts/devnet/local-phase-d-rehearsal.sh` (`paw-testnet-1`)
- `genesis.sha256`: SHA256 checksum (0ad9a1be3badff543e777501c74d577249cfc0c13a0759e5b90c544a8688d106)
- `peers.txt`: Persistent peers from the local rehearsal (node1 + validators 2-4), mapped to public endpoints (`rpc1-4.paw-testnet.io:26656`). Seeds intentionally empty until sentries are published.
- `paw-testnet-1-manifest.json`: Machine-readable manifest with chain_id, genesis sha, peers (references `peers.txt`), pawd sha, RPC/REST/gRPC endpoints, status page, and bundle metadata (file + sha256).
- Status page: https://status.paw-testnet.io (monitors RPC/REST/gRPC/Explorer/Faucet/Metrics)
- `artifacts/paw-testnet-1-artifacts.tar.gz`: Generated by `scripts/devnet/bundle-testnet-artifacts.sh` for easy CDN upload (sha256=78b27d1c02196531b7907773874520447e0be2bee4b95b781085c9e11b6a90de; checksum also published in `paw-testnet-1-artifacts.sha256`)
- Remote validation helper: `scripts/devnet/validate-remote-artifacts.sh <cdn-url>` now verifies optional `*-artifacts.sha256`, bundle hash, manifest, peers, and status page reachability.
- Verification: `./scripts/devnet/verify-network-artifacts.sh paw-testnet-1` (passed at 2025-12-15T16:53:36Z UTC; seeds empty by design)
## Public Endpoints (live)
- RPC: https://rpc1.paw-testnet.io, https://rpc2.paw-testnet.io
- REST: https://api.paw-testnet.io
- gRPC: https://grpc.paw-testnet.io:443
- Faucet: https://faucet.paw-testnet.io
- Explorer: https://explorer.paw-testnet.io
- Status: https://status.paw-testnet.io

## Remote Validation
- Attempted: 2026-01-12 — `./scripts/devnet/validate-remote-artifacts.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poaiw-blockchain/paw/main/networks/paw-testnet-1` (blocked: 404 from GitHub raw; repo not publicly readable). Re-run after artifacts are hosted on a public CDN/bucket.

## Pending
- Announce onboarding once CDN/bucket hosting is published (currently validating via GitHub raw URLs).

## Artifact Notes
- Local rehearsal covered bank transfer + DEX pool + swap via `scripts/devnet/smoke_tests.sh` (pawd sha256=3d301da4fd2f21b52f6f208e11e9e7f3e4626522fe711f08e2c7c2ce9f5cde02).
- `scripts/devnet/verify-network-artifacts.sh paw-testnet-1` validated genesis checksum and peer metadata after packaging.
- Sentries are not published yet; add public seeds/persistent peers before inviting external validators.

Refer to `docs/guides/deployment/PUBLIC_TESTNET.md` for the full deployment and onboarding runbook.
