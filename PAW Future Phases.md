# PAW Future Phases

This companion document captures medium-to-long-term targets that remain intentionally decoupled from the manageable initial release.

## Phase 2+ Focus Areas

- **zkML Rollouts**: Integrate zero-knowledge proofs for common AI models (transformers, CNNs, diffusion networks) to enable privacy-preserving workloads, recursive proof composition, and hardware acceleration where needed.
- **Sharding & Data Scaling**: Add execution shards beyond the first compute shard, implement account-based state sharding, and introduce erasure coding for data availability while keeping cross-shard atomicity via Merkle proofs.
- **Interoperability Bridges**: Expand cross-chain connectivity (Cosmos IBC, Polkadot, and Ethereum-compatible bridges) once the DEX liquidity and atomic swap foundations prove stable.
- **Advanced Governance Modes**: Phase in AI-assisted governance adjustments, quadratic voting for community funds, and prediction-market-based treasury decisions after the Guardian DAO proves effective.
- **Global DEX Enhancements**: Extend the built-in DEX with advanced order types, liquidity mining pools, and yield optimization tools, plus a refreshed GUI targeted at regional app stores.
- **Mobile & Edge-first Experiences**: Publish native mobile apps that interoperate with the responsive PWA, support QR/NFC onboarding, and surface push notifications/biometric confirmations for staking and voting.

## Deployment Triggers

- **Usage Metrics**: Only unlock these phases once on-chain liquidity, task throughput, and wallet adoption hit governance-defined benchmarks.
- **Security Audits**: Each advanced feature tier requires a fresh security audit or third-party review before roll-out.
- **Reserve Funding**: The `Reserve for Future Adoption` (15M PAW) funds bounty programs, developer grants, and liquidity incentives that bootstrap these future phases.
