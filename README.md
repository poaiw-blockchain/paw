# PAW Manageable Blockchain

This repo hosts the condensed PAW release: a lean layer-1 blockchain with a built-in DEX, secure API compute aggregation, and multi-device, mobile-friendly wallets. The key artifacts are:

- `PAW Extensive whitepaper .md`: the core spec covering tokenomics, DEX strategy, reward model, governance expansion, and launch roadmap.
- `PAW Future Phases.md`: a companion roadmap for later zkML, sharding, interoperability, and governance upgrades.

## Goals & Experience

- **Rapid Adoption**: Elevated early rewards for validators, node operators, and compute partners plus atomic-swap-ready liquidity pools and GUI hooks for quick onboarding.
- **DEX First**: Native AMM/atomic swap primitives, multi-token wallets, QR-friendly GUI, and mobile/desktop parity deliver liquidity-first functionality on day one.
- **Open Governance**: Delegated voting groups drawn via VRF expand participation beyond the initial validator set while the Guardian DAO governs upgrades and the adoption reserve.

## Getting Started

1. Review `PAW Extensive whitepaper .md` for launch details.
2. Reference `PAW Future Phases.md` when planning later scaling or privacy-focused releases.
3. Build GUIs and wallets that mirror the described QR / biometric flows to ensure the chain ships with consumer-ready UX.

## Publishing
Use the provided GitHub remote to push once the implementation is ready. The repository is configured to deploy the content above and should host any future contracts, SDKs, or UI prototypes.
